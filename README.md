# ❤️ Heart Failure Prediction System
*A Machine Learning–powered Streamlit application for early heart failure risk detection.*

---

## 📌 Overview
The **Heart Failure Prediction System** is an interactive web application built using **Streamlit** that predicts the likelihood of heart failure based on multiple health parameters.  
Using a **Logistic Regression model** with feature scaling, the app provides a highly interpretable and fast prediction pipeline.

The goal of the project is to support individuals, students, and researchers in understanding heart failure risk through data-driven insights.

## ✨ Features

### 🔮 Heart Failure Prediction
Enter several personal and medical parameters such as:
- Age  
- Sex  
- Chest Pain Type  
- Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar  
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved  
- ST Depression (Oldpeak)  
- Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Slope  
- Resting ECG  
- And others…

After submitting, the app provides:
- **Risk Prediction (Yes/No)**
- **Probability Score (%)**

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Explore key data insights including:
- Distribution plots  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Feature relationships  
- Outliers and pattern detection  

This helps users understand how different features relate to heart failure.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Model
- Model Used: **Logistic Regression**  
- Preprocessing: **Individual feature scaling**  
- Output Classes:  
  - `0` → Not likely to have heart failure  
  - `1` → Likely to have heart failure  

The model is trained on a well-known heart disease dataset.
